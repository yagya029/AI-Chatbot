# AI-Chatbot
This project is an AI-powered conversational chatbot built using Google Gemini API and Streamlit, designed to provide intelligent, real-time responses through a simple and interactive web interface. The chatbot supports context-aware conversations and can be extended with voice input/output and other advanced AI features.
The AI Chatbot leverages Google’s Gemini large language model to understand user queries and generate accurate, human-like responses. Streamlit is used to build a clean and responsive frontend, enabling users to interact with the chatbot seamlessly through a browser.

The project demonstrates practical implementation of:

Generative AI
